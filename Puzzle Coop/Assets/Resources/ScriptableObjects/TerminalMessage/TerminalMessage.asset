  - "March 05 19XX\nI\u2019ve installed the monitors on the wall, it would look like
    leaves on a tree if I add some designs. I grew up in a town where people despise
    technology, that\u2019s why the lab will be hidden in the first place. I don\u2019t
    know the reason, maybe they are scared of change that they were always a victim
    of false information or maybe it\u2019s something deeper.\r\n"
  - "March 07 19XX\nI was just done with the upper levels of my lab and for the past
    few weeks it took most of my time. I\u2019ve thought about it before, but it\u2019s
    true there are no easy courses yet there are also no hard ones specially when
    your heart desires it. In time, everything will feel natural for everything can
    be learned.\r\n"
  - "August 15 19XX\nI tried tinkering with the frequencies. And I\u2019ve been grounded
    way too many times. But I think I\u2019m close to something greater! They say
    it\u2019s always good to be hungry for new knowledge. It doesn\u2019t mean you
    need to know everything immediately. But it\u2019s better to be eager to know
    things, how they work, or what they are used for.\r\n"
  - "September 21 19XX\nI KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! There is so much more than
    \u2018just\u2019 being an IT! If the town\u2019s people only knew this, they\u2019ll
    be stock! (no puns intended). I just need to remember to master the fundamentals,
    I know for sure that will help me in the long run.\r\n"
  - "October 11 19XX\nMATH! WHO KNEW?! I\u2019ve never thought of adding math problems
    in my coding, yet here I am. But I must learn to be comfortable with problems,
    for an IT are like problem solvers especially in technical problems. If you gave
    up in simple problems, then you lose. I should try solving it one at a time instead
    of giving up.\r\n"
  - "November 17 19XX\nIt took YEARS! My blood and sweat, but now it\u2019s done!
    And I couldn\u2019t even be any prouder of myself! At this point I only need
    to worry for the maintenance and upgrades for this place. I\u2019m proud of myself
    for not giving up on something that I really want to learn despite what this
    town believes. I know that everything takes time that I should be consistent
    and that I must always trust the process.\r\n"
