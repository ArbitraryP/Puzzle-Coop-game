  stringGeneral: "When I was twelve, I\u2019ve read a comic strip in a newspaper.
    It was a conversation between a chef and another person in a supermarket, the
    person asks \u201CCan you prepare a full course meal?\u201D the chef answered
    \u201CNo\u201D. Surprised the person said \u201CWhat do you mean? You said you\u2019re
    a chef, so why can\u2019t you prepare a full course meal then?\u201D The chef
    replied \u201CYou see, I am a chef. I\u2019m a Pastry Chef, I make desserts and
    pastries not appetizers nor main course meals.\u201D"
  stringP1: "Hijo, isn\u2019t it fascinating how time changes everything how letters
    in newspapers turned into noises in radios, and noises from radios turned into
    visuals in TVs."
  stringP2: Ada, remember the time you told me how different animals uses different
    frequencies to either communicate or hunt food and that you were sad because
    they cannot talk like us humans so we had to buy you an ice cream to cheer you
    up.
