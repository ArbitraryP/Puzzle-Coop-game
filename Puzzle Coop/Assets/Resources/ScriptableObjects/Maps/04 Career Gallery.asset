  stringGeneral: "After the incident I started building my secret lab where I moved
    all my research and books relating to technology, there I continuously did my
    own studies where I found that there are vast occupations an IT person can pursue.
    That there are specific roles an IT person plays depending on what profession
    they\u2019ll choose."
  stringP1: "Charles. Hijo, they say that people are brought up by the society they
    live in and one must fit to be truly accepted. That was the case for me, but
    it was suffocating I wasn\u2019t able to freely do or show what truly made me
    happy."
  stringP2: "Hija, in life there are a lot of directions and we must choose what
    to pick or where to go. It may lead to some twist and turns and may even end
    up on a dead end but as long as you\u2019re in a path you must always keep on
    moving."
