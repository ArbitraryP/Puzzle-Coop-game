    the situation to have a better understanding."

    hope you and your sister are the ones who\u2019s reading this. In both of your
    hands I rest my life\u2019s work I entrust you both the information and knowledge
    that I have accumulated my entire life."

    hope you and your brother are the ones who\u2019s reading this. What aspirations
    you and your brother may have for the future, know that there are no words to
    express how proud I am for the both of you."
