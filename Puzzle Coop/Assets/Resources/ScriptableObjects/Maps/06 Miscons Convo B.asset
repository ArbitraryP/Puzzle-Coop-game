  stringGeneral: "In my late teenage years I remember teaching and telling people
    about technology, most of the town's people obviously hated it. Yet surprisingly
    a handful of people listened to me at first, then after they asked me if I can
    fix their TVs and other appliances. But I told them I don\u2019t have the knowledge
    to do so and got mad at me at that point I remembered the comic strip I\u2019ve
    read then I was 12."
  stringP1: "Charles, remember when you used to ask me why they were playing Christmas
    carols in the radio when it was the first week of September. I don\u2019t really
    know the answers myself. Maybe some things are left a mystery after all."
  stringP2: "Ada, when you were younger I always notice you staring at the clock
    and waiting for it to turn 3 o\u2019clock then you would go to me and asks for
    your \u2018meryenda\u2019 then you would happily eat your \u2018ensaymadas\u2019
    and orange juice while watching cartoons on the TV."
