  stringGeneral: "Hijo Hija, remember when your puppy got lost? We decided to put
    up missing posters. And I gave each of you five printed copies, you both said
    that those copies weren\u2019t enough so I gave you the exact amount of money
    to make another ten printed copies, you ran to the store and came back with the
    ten copies and ten candies. Telling me that xerox was way cheaper than printed,
    I was so proud of how smart both of you were."
  stringP1: Charles, do you believe that history repeats itself? You know this room
    may look the same as the last two but it still differs. Like history, it may
    repeat but it will always give us new more things to learn from.
  stringP2: "Ada, you might ask \u201CIsn\u2019t this room and the past two rooms
    look the same?\u201D But remember, bat is different from bat and bat. One flies,
    the other hits a ball, and the last flutters."
