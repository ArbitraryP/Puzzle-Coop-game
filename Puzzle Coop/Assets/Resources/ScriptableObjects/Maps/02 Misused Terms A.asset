  stringGeneral: "I was scanning some magazines the other day and I stumble upon
    an article about keypad phones and got interested. It would be an easier way
    to be connected with your father and I can also study the device, so I bought
    one. I don\u2019t know much about it but it said to use a micro SD card so I
    took the SD card from my DSLR camera thinking the two were the same, but when
    I try putting it in it won\u2019t fit. I guess I still have a lot to learn after
    all."
  stringP1: "Charles, there will be times that you and your sister will be in an
    argument. That is also part of growing up and there is nothing wrong in it, but
    it will only be considered wrong when you don\u2019t try communicating to one
    another, it may take a few tries but I know both of you can fix it together."
  stringP2: Hija, sometimes there will be a lot of choices but only one right answer.
    You can try and choose for multiple times but if you yourself are unsure of it
    there is nothing wrong if you ask for help. And I know for a fact that your brother
    will always be there to help you.
