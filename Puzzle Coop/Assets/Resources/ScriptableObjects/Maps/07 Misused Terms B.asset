  stringGeneral: "I was so proud when your Dad told me he wanted to study Graphic
    Designing I was one hundred and one percent fully on board with his aspirations
    he was a very artistic child and I know it would fit him perfectly. One day he
    told me that he\u2019s going to buy a new System Unit so he can achieve better
    performance, I told him why not upgrading his CPU instead it would be cheaper.
    He replied, \u201CI though those two were the same?\u201D"
  stringP1: "Hijo, life is like a puzzle it may look like it would fit perfectly
    but it\u2019s just not the right piece. We may believe that the first thing we
    learn or know would always be the right thing, but sometimes it\u2019s not and
    it\u2019s fine we just have to keep on learning."
  stringP2: "Hija, a lot of people believed that when you fixed a problem it\u2019s
    just that \u201Ca problem solved\u201D we never stop and appreciate what we could
    have learned in the process of fixing it or what may have caused it. Remember
    all knowledge is good knowledge depends on how you\u2019ll use it."
